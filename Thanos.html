            <h1>10 Thanos Moments That Deserved To Be In The MCU</h1>
            <p>At this point Thanos is a household name, up there with Darth 
                Vader and Voldemort in the hall of well-known villains. This 
                is almost entirely due to his stellar portrayal in the MCU, 
                which arguably did a better job with Thanos than a lot of his comics.
                <br>
                <br>
                That being said, the films can be a bit limiting for poor Thanos, 
                with the movies being too family friendly for some of his 
                darker moments, and a bit too serious for his wackier moments.
                <br>
                <br>
                But that doesn't mean it can't be done! And now that everyone and their
                grandma knows who Thanos is, it's the perfect time to bring
                him back from the dead and put some of his best (and possibly worst)
                moments on the big screen. Lets have Josh Brolin fly a tiny yellow 
                helicopter or help old ladies across the street! He could 
                lose a fight to squirrels and torture one specific guy named Dave!
                <br>
                <br>
                So (for any Marvel executives reading) here are the perfect 
                Thanos moments from across the comics that DESPERATELY need some screen time.</p>

            <h1>10. That Time He Made Deadpool Immortal Out Of Spite</h1>
            <p>Unlike his MCU counterpart, comic Thanos loves Death. And not just inflicting it, 
                Thanos is in love with the literal personification of Death. 
                The issue is Death doesn’t love him back; she only has eyes 
                for one Wade "merc with a mouth" Wilson, AKA Deadpool.
                <br>
                <br>
                So like any good incel Thanos spends his time throwing temper tantrums 
                and complaining Deadpool isn’t good enough for her (which in this case might actually be true). 
                Not that it makes a difference though - Death is a grown cosmic entity and 
                can make her own decisions. Thanos, however, isn't the most progressive 
                when it comes to cosmic romance, and in the pages of Deadpool #64, 
                finally decides to do something about his romantic rival, cursing Deadpool 
                with immortality so he and Death can never be together.
                <br>
                <br>
                So how would this look on screen? Well we already know Ryan Reynolds
                and Josh Brolin work well together, as demonstrated by their 
                partnership in Deadpool 2, and a romantic comedy where Deadpool 
                and Thanos compete for the affections of a literal skeleton 
                is the movie we all need to combat Marvel fatigue.</p>

            <h1>9. That Time He Fought Commando Galactus</h1>
            <p>What lies at the very end of the Marvel universe? What is 
                still standing long after everything else is dead? Thanos, 
                obviously. In the Thanos Wins storyline we get an 
                insight into what the Marvel universe looks like when 
                Thanos has succeeded in killing everything.
                <br>
                <br>
                After he kills all the heroes of Earth, 
                Thanos turns his attentions to the cosmic beings 
                that inhabit the universe, and this of course means Galactus. 
                In response, the big purple world eater and his new 
                partner the Cosmic Ghost Rider (Frank Castle), arm themselves up 
                in true commando style and go to hunt down Thanos.
                <br>
                <br>
                Needless to say, it does not go in their favour.
                <br>
                <br>
                With rumours circling about Galactus making an appearance
                in Phase 4, what better way to introduce him 
                than a John Wick style shootout with Thanos? It's the action movie we all deserve.

            <h1>8. That Time He Defeated A Cosmic Pantheon</h1>
            <p>Beating Galactus not enough for you? How about beating Galactus and all the cosmic gods at the same time?
                <br>
                <br>
                Everyone knows that when Thanos got his hands on the Infinity Gauntlet he used it to 
                eliminate half of all life in the universe, but in the pages of the Infinity 
                Gauntlet comic he used the stones for so much more.
                <br>
                <br>
                From manifesting grand structures in the vacuum of space, 
                to creating elaborate tortures for his enemies, Thanos was 
                truly creative with his godlike power. But most impressive 
                is how he used the gauntlet to fight a pantheon of cosmic beings, 
                including Galactus, Lord Chaos and Master Order alongside a few others, simultaneously.
                <br>
                <br>
                What we have here is the opportunity for an epic Endgame style conflict, 
                but on a truly cosmic scale. With massive entities hitting each other 
                with planets, while Thanos and the embodiment of time 
                throw each other into dinosaurs, what more does anyone need?

            <h1>7. That Time He Lost To Squirrel Girl</h1>
            <p>With all the immense strength Thanos has shown, it's 
                sometimes easy to forget he isn’t the most powerful character 
                in the Marvel canon. No, that honour goes to none other than Squirrel Girl.
                <br>
                <br>
                That’s right, the girl with the proportionate speed and strength 
                of a squirrel has a proven track record of beating some of Marvel's 
                heaviest hitters, including Doctor Doom, Galactus and of course Thanos.
                <br>
                <br>
                The two clash in GLX Christmas special, in which Thanos 
                arrives and threatens to drain the life of everyone on Earth. 
                Squirrel Girl jumps into battle and defeats the Mad Titan off panel, 
                cheating audiences out of seeing Thanos fighting an army of squirrels.
                <br>
                <br>
                This one sells itself, to be honest. Thanos, the planet conquering demigod, 
                taken out by a teenager and an army of squirrels.

            <h1>6. That Time He Helped An Old Lady Across The Street</h1>
            <p>Quite possibly the most deviously evil thing Thanos has ever done 
                was helping an old lady across the street. How is this evil you might ask? 
                Well, that’s a bit of a story. In the annual issue of Thanos's comic series, 
                we are treated to a series of lesser known Thanos stories - one of 
                which occurred when Thanos had the Infinity Gauntlet.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the time stone allowing him to see infinite potential futures, Thanos hatched a plan.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the futures Thanos saw involved a young woman from Earth. 
                This young lady had a bright future. She was going to cure to disease, 
                end hunger and usher in a new age of peace across the universe. 
                And it all starts with a chance meeting getting off a bus. 
                Something Thanos prevents by delaying the bus through helping an old lady across the street.
                <br>
                <br>
                To add insult to injury when this poor woman is on her deathbed, 
                having lived a mediocre life thanks to Thanos, the Mad Titan 
                appears and shows her everything she would have accomplished if not for him.
                <br>
                <br>
                We have all seen what Thanos can do on grand scale, 
                so let's get some screen time dedicated to his cruelty on a small scale.

            <h1>5. That Time He Put All Of Existance In A Chokehold</h1>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, Thanos and Deadpool are romantic rivals - 
                both competing for the affections of Death herself. So in Deadpool vs Thanos, 
                when Death goes missing, who better to team up and find her? 
                As a newly formed gruesome twosome, Thanos and Deadpool travel the galaxy 
                to rescue their lost love.
                <br>
                <br>
                The pair eventually find out that she has been kidnapped by Eternity itself, 
                AKA the living embodiment of the Marvel universe. Thanos sees 
                his opportunity to strike and with a little help from Death, grabs eternity 
                and literally tries to choke the life out of him.
                <br>
                <br>
                And he would've gotten away with it too if it 
                wasn't for that meddling Deadpool and his newly acquired Captain Universe powers!
                <br>
                <br>
                This one doesn't even need selling as a movie. Thanos wrestles 
                the concept of existence and Deadpool gets magical universe powers - it writes itself.

            <h1>4. That Time He Became The Punisher</h1>
            <p>Thanos has had a lot of titles in his day, 
                but one title I don’t think anyone expected him to get was The Punisher.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanos is the end of all things and as they say, strange times 
                lead to strange bedfellows. Towards the end of his life, 
                Thanos finds himself with the Cosmic Ghost Rider as his right hand man, who 
                just so happens to be Frank Castle, the original Punisher.
                <br>
                <br>
                After Castle and Galactus failed to defeat Thanos, Cosmic 
                Ghost Rider was spared so he could serve Thanos and provide him with 
                a penance stare each morning. Eventually Castle is killed and 
                thanks to some antics from Odin gets the opportunity to go back in time to 
                rehabilitate Thanos, something that is described as the worst 
                decision ever made in all living history.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the pages of Cosmic Ghost Rider we see this plan in action 
                and it of course goes badly, and only ends up turning 
                Thanos into a version of The Punisher.
                <br>
                <br>
                Terrible for the universe, but great for us, a gritty Netflix drama about 
                The Punisher already exists and it's great. A gritty Netflix drama about 
                Thanos The Punisher should exist and would (probably) be even better.

            <h1>3. That Time He Had The Thanos Copter</h1>
            <p>In this Super Spidey story, Thanos gets his hands on the cosmic cube
                - you know, that thing that can alter reality on a whim? 
                And he still somehow manages to lose, and not even to the Avengers or anything big; 
                he is thwarted by Spider Man, Hellcat and a small child.
                <br>
                <br>
                After Thanos just drops the cube (for the second time) a young boy picks it up 
                and uses it to tie Thanos up, after which two regular police officers just 
                arrest him with no issue.
                <br>
                <br>
                But as entertaining as that scene would be on screen, 
                even better would be the tiny yellow helicopter Thanos pilots 
                to get the cube. You all the know the one - it has his 
                name on the side so he doesn’t lose it.

            <h1>2. That Time He Tortured Dave</h1>
            <p>We have seen Thanos commit cosmic genocide on a semi regular basis, 
                and with that it's easy to overlook the fact that Thanos 
                always makes time for the little evils. However, even if its it’s the smallest things, 
                Thanos still does it better than anyone else.
                <br>
                <br>
                A prime example is his torture of a perfectly regular man named David. 
                Every year on poor David’s birthday Thanos shows up and tries to ruin 
                David’s life, starting on little Dave's first birthday when Thanos stole his blanket.
                <br>
                <br>
                From there, the Mad Titan made sure these annual traditions were 
                the worst days of David's life. Killing Dave's father, 
                friends and cat, breaking up with his girlfriend and flooding his house; 
                no evil is too much or too little for Thanos.
                <br>
                <br>
                All we need now is a slice of life series where Thanos occasionally shows 
                up and makes everything worse, then disappears again until next season.
                .</p>
        </section>

    <div>
        <section id="Thanos-preview">
            <h1>1. That Time He Killed His Future Self</h1>
            <p>As you know from his fight with Galactus, the Thanos Wins story line shows him 
                as the end of all things - you might even say he is “inevitable”. 
                However, this does come with a downside. As an immortal and having killed everyone 
                else in the universe, Thanos has no one left to kill him.
                <br>
                <br>
                So who better to do the Job than Thanos himself? 
                Old man Thanos literally pulls a younger version of himself 
                from the past to come and kill him in the future. Something 
                young Thanos does, not through murder, but by changing the past so 
                old man Thanos never existed in the first place. Because Thanos does no man’s dirty 
                work - not even his own
                <br>
                <br>
                Hugh Jackman already proved that fighting a younger version of yourself 
                in a movie works flawlessly with Logan. Now all we need is the same thing done in the 
                MCU. Bring Thanos back and have him fight himself!
