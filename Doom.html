            <h1>10 Doctor Doom moments that prove we need him in the MCU</h1>
            <p>Doctor doom has had a rough time on screen. Whether it’s that time in 2005 
                when he was beaten by the Human Torch and a fire hydrant, or 2015 when he became 
                a strange psychic robot, poor Victor hasn’t had much luck with film.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite this Doctor Doom has remained a fan favourite and continues to be 
                one of the largest threats to the entire Marvel universe.
                <br>
                <br>
                From stealing all the vibranium in Wakanda to becoming a god (twice), he 
                has proven time and time again that if he could just keep his ego in check, he would 
                have conquered the world a hundred times over.
                <br>
                <br>
                With that in mind, let's explore the moments that prove its long past time Doctor 
                Doom got his moment in the spotlight, with all the other big hitters of the Marvel 
                Cinematic Universe...</p>

            <h1>10. The Time He Sold Doctor Strange To Mephisto - Triumph And Torment</h1>
            <p>Despite his image as a villain, in the beginning Doom wanted nothing more that 
                to save his mother from the clutches of Mephisto (Marvel’s Satan). Once a year 
                Doom would challenge Mephisto for the fate of his mother’s soul, something that 
                didn’t exactly go his way. That is until 1989 when writer Roger Stern and artist 
                Mike Mignola had him team up with Doctor Strange in Triumph and Torment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shortly after their arrival in Hell, the Doctors begin to realise that they don’t 
                stand a chance at winning. When the two become separated - Doctor Strange trapped in 
                his own memories and Doctor Doom facing Mephisto himself. The Prince of Lies makes Doom 
                an offer - Doctor Strange’s soul in exchange for his mother’s, a deal Doom seemingly accepts.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was only after dear old mum became so offended that her son would sell the Sorcerer Supreme 
                just to save her soul and refused to be freed that Doctor Dooms’ plan could kick in. Thanks to 
                his mother’s pure act (and a handy gadget Doom slipped to Doctor Strange), the Sorcerer Supreme 
                was able to use the light of this pure act to wound Mephisto and free Victor’s mother.

            <h1>9. That Time He Beat Up A Lion While Naked - Doom</h1>
            <p>In his armour Doctor Doom can contend with cosmic level threats. With an 
                arsenal of technology rivalling Tony Stark and enough magic to challenge 
                Doctor Strange, Doom’s armour makes him pretty much unstoppable. So, take 
                all that away and what is he? A man who can kill a lion with a single punch, that’s what!
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks to some antics from Franklin Richards (the cosmic powered child of Reed and Sue Richards), 
                Victor Von Doom finds himself stranded and naked in the Serengeti of an alternate earth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before he can even get his thoughts together, he is immediately attacked by a lion. Doom being 
                Doom immediately lunges at the beast and in one clean punch, he brings it down to the ground.
                <br>
                <br>
                Vic then promptly skins the lion and uses it to make a new suit complete with mask, which may 
                just be the most metal thing ever done. (Well, that or selling a magician to the devil to save 
                your mother.)

            <h1>8. That Time He Used Galactus As A Stepping-Stone To Become God - Secret Wars (1984)</h1>
            <p>In 1984’s Secret Wars event, a select group of heroes and villains from across the Marvel 
                universe were gathered together by an impossibly powerful being known as the Beyonder. These 
                two groups were pitted against each other with the promise, “slay your enemies and all you 
                desire shall be yours”.
                <br>
                <br>
                Doctor Doom isn’t one for games though and started working on a plan to challenge the Beyonder. 
                This plan had him cut up the body of the supervillain Claw (the man made of living sound) and 
                use him to steal Galactus’ powers.
                <br>
                <br>
                This makes Doom easily strong enough to win the contest, but what would killing the Avengers,
                Fantastic Four and X-Men be when you can challenge God himself?
                <br>
                <br>
                Doom of course succeeds and gains the powers of the Beyonder, becoming a supremely powerful being.
                Something he only loses due to some body-hopping antics from a surviving shard of the Beyonder.
                <br>
                <br>
                Either way, this will forever serve as proof that Doctor Doom should not be invited to game night.

            <h1>7. The Time He Attacked SHIELD With Russian Nesting Doll Robots - Ultimate Spider-Man</h1>
            <p>While Victor has had a rough time in film, he has fared much better in the animated world, 
                with one of his more wonderfully weird appearances coming in the Ultimate Spider-man animated 
                series. In the episode Doomed, the young heroes decide to prove them themselves by catching 
                SHIELD's #1 most wanted, Doctor Doom.
                <br>
                <br>
                The kids seem to do well at first, successfully capturing Doom and returning him to the Shield Helicarrier. 
                Only after he arrives does Doom reveal he was not captured and had instead sent the Mark-6 Hoberman, 
                which is a fancy term for a Doombot with a bunch of smaller Doombots inside, each smaller than the last.
                <br>
                <br>
                The robots very nearly crash the Helicarrier and everyone inside. This appearance is a bit on the childish 
                side but it’s worth it to hear a tiny Doombot yell “feel the wrath of Doom!” with a voice that sounds like 
                a mouthful of helium.

            <h1>6. That Time He Took Out Most Of The Criminal Underworld In One Go - Infamous Iron Man</h1>
            <p>During the events of Infamous Iron, Man Doctor Doom finds himself on the side of the angels. 
                Taking up the mantle of the then comatose Tony Stark, Doom declared himself a hero and went 
                about trying to fix the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the ways Doom went about this was to use his knowledge of the criminal underworld 
                to arrest a large gathering of villains in one fell swoop (ironically, the villains had 
                gathered in a panic after hearing Doctor Doom had gone straight).
                <br>
                <br>
                As they frantically tried to figure out how to protect themselves, 
                Doom bursts through the roof and unleashing a fury that brings the villains to their knees, 
                including heavy hitters such as the Wizard, the Wrecking Crew, the Hood and Jigsaw.

            <h1>5. That time he flashed The The Panther God - Doomwar</h1>
            <p>In 2010, Doctor Doom successfully did the impossible, he invaded the 
                African nation of Wakanda. After funding a coup that banished T’challa 
                from his home, Doom set his sights on Wakanda’s treasure, the vibranium mound.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, T’challa (being a genius himself) hid the vibranium behind a series of 
                locks, each more complicated than the last. The last of these locks was to be 
                deemed worthy by the Panther God herself, something the Black Panther assumed 
                Doom could never do. Doctor Doom having never understood the meaning of the word 
                impossible, immediately strips down to his birthday suit and offers himself up for judgement.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Panther God then realises that not only does Doom want to create a peaceful 
                world for all mankind, but that out of a million different futures, his is the 
                only one that creates a world without evil. I personally think the most important 
                question here is if this technically makes Doctor Doom the new Black Panther.

            <h1>4. That Time He Sacrificed Himself To The Marvel Zombies - Ultimate Fantastic Four</h1>
            <p>The Ultimate universe was a more realistic take on the main Marvel universe, 
                with a grounded approach to the majority of the Marvel roster. Doctor Doom 
                received this treatment as well, going from Victor Von Doom to Victor Van Damme 
                (no relation to Jean-Claude).
                <br>
                <br>
                Van Damme might be a bit more grounded than usual but that doesn’t stop him being 
                a lovely dose of overkill. During their adventures, the Ultimate Fantastic Four 
                managed to bring back their zombie counterparts. When the zombies break free and the 
                Human Torch is infected with a celestial parasite, Reed Richards turns to Van Damme for help.
                <br>
                <br>
                After some classic body switching, Van Damme finds himself honour bound to 
                carry the parasite and the Zombies back to the their home dimension and trap 
                himself there. The arc ends with Victor Van Damme squaring off against the recently 
                powered up Galactus Zombies, finishing on the line “Well this should be a challenge”. 
                He isn’t wrong.

            <h1>3. That Time He Became Galactus And Ate The Entire Universe - Marvel Two In One: The Thing & Human Torch</h1>
            <p>On an alternate earth, the Fantastic Four’s first encounter with Galactus did not go 
                in their favour. After the Thing was killed trying beat the purple force of nature 
                in a fist fight, Reed Richards went mad with grief and tried to kill Galactus himself, 
                an effort that left the whole world defenceless.
                <br>
                <br>
                Enter Doom, with a plan and fancy alien technology, who quickly sets to work 
                on building a device to save the world, something he achieves by swapping minds
                with Galactus, leaving the devourer trapped in Doom’s body, while Doom’s 
                mind now controls the cosmic force of nature itself.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite his newfound hunger, Doom swore to the people of Earth that 
                they would be spared. Being a man of his word Doom did not eat the Earth, 
                he ate everything else. Literally everything. Like the Hungriest Caterpillar 
                Doom ate the entire universe.

            <h1>2. That Time He Saved Christmas - What The?! X-Mas Special</h1>
            <p>While Doctor Doom may be a villain feared by adults across the globe, 
                for one magical Christmas eve he was a hero to children worldwide. 
                Set to the tune of Night before Christmas, this comic tells a classic Christmas tale. 
                You know, the one where Santa tries to deliver presents to a supervillain and gets caught 
                in a giant bear-trap. It's a classic.
                <br>
                <br>
                The newly injured Santa gives Doom an offer: deliver all the presents 
                and he will be granted his heart’s desire, an offer that was apparently 
                too good to pass up (and one Santa could follow through on, what with him 
                being an omega-level mutant and all). The adventure ends with Santa Doom fighting 
                the Avengers and Fantastic Four, which is only stopped when a group of sick 
                children ask why the heroes are beating up Santa.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the time comes for the real Santa to grant Doom his wish, 
                Doom reveals his wish has already been granted in the form of a 
                teddy bear gifted to him by the children. Either that or he stole it 
                (but that isn’t in the Christmas spirit).

            <h1>1. That Time He Became God (Again) And Ripped Out Thanos’s Spine - Secret Wars (2015)</h1>
            <p>As time progresses, comics will inevitably re-tread old ground and with a new Secret 
                Wars came a new godly powered Doom. This Doom was the God Emperor of Battleworld, a 
                patch-work planet consisting of various sections of the Marvel multiverse. 
                Ruling with an iron fist, Doom was worshipped as a God while allowing the 
                more powerful of the Marvel roster to rule areas of Battleworld as Barons.
                <br>
                <br>
                Towards the end of the event, God Emperor Doom found himself in the midst of a 
                rebellion led by the surviving heroes and villains of the 616 and Ultimate universes. 
                Between Hulks raining from the sky and a giant version of the Thing slugging it 
                out against a flaming Galactus, the revolution had a lot going on. But that 
                didn’t stop Thanos from going straight for the God Emperor himself.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanos challenges Doom, bragging that even without an Infinity Gauntlet 
                he could Defeat him... something that he regrets immediately, 
                as Doom reaches into his chest and rips out his spine with skull still attached.
                <br>
                <br>
                And if you don’t think that’s a moment we need on screen, then I’m sorry, 
                but you might hate fun.
